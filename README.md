Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm that excels in predicting continuous numerical values. It works by finding a hyperplane that best represents the relationship between input features and the target variable. This hyperplane is positioned to maximize the margin between the actual data points and a predefined margin threshold. SVR is particularly effective when dealing with non-linear and complex datasets, thanks to the use of kernel functions that transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, enabling better separation of data points. SVR is known for its robustness and ability to handle outliers effectively, making it a valuable tool in various regression tasks across domains like finance, economics, and engineering.
